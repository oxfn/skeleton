# Skeleton project

## Overview

Sometimes it is fun and useful to build your profile from scratch for actual
needs. Sometimes it is necessary to start doing things immediately on fresh
system installation. Fortunately, *nix systems are designed in smart way and
help us to efficiently move profile between homogeneous systems.

*Skeleton* project is my aim to keep and reproduce some Linux shell experience
and developments and share it with you. Hope you'll find something useful here.
